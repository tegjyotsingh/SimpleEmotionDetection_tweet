sometimesiwishthat you would come back and not leave again :(
sometimes jumping in puddles isnt so bad thelittlethings
sometimes people do stuff and i can never understand why they would ever do that messedup
sometimes people need to be hurt the way they hurt others in order to grow as a person too often they're still lost even after that
sometimes badday abettertomorrow grumpy
sometimes trying and trying again doesnt work out as planned when you have tried with all your heart sigh strong storyofmylife
sometimes u try to do the right thing & make peace but i guess u can't force peace & friendship w those determined to hate & be alone
sometimes wen i dwell on school memories i stop myself cos i think that i'm the only lame something that still remembers that
sometimes when i close my eyes i can't see :(
sometimes you don't get what you want but you can't dwell on it just pick up the pieces and move on true
sometimes you just can't hold the heavy weight anymore and you just have to let it fall and start over broken lonely
sometimes you just want to say to hell with it to hell with everyone fedup
