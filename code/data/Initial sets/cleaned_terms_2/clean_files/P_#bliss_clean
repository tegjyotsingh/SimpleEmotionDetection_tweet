There are very few feelings as good as jumping in your own bed after a week away from it 
There is a God @peaches_madge has no voice  
There is a pencil in my hand and paper infront of me.Ihave a cup of camomile tea and Top Gear is on. Plus it's raining.  #happyplace
There is no greater love story than that of me and my bed  #fallinlovealloveragain
There is nothing like a clean room, candles, and a book on a rainy night. 
There is nothing like a good cup of coffee after a lecture 
There is nothing more euphoric than the feeling of a warm bubble bath. 
there is no where I would rather be than sitting with @andjustaddwater & writing my paper with the window open. I am happy  #soulmates
There is something so peaceful about the sound of rain as you fall asleep  
There really is nothing quite like walking to class in the pouring rain.  #MIprobs
there's a channel on my tv that's just calming music and swimming sea turtles 
There's no place like home 
Theres nothing like listening to a bit of @JackSavoretti on a lovely sunny afternoon 
There's nothing more relaxing & therapeutic than walking along the river & sit listening to the birds & walking the world go by :) 
There's notin lk listening to d best of SWV....*dancing**
