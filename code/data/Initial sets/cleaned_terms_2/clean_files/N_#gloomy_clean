How often has Grand Rapids seen April showers? According to @lauravelasquez, "at least the last 13 days in a row." 
I actually don't mind being in the library all day on a day like this 
I always listen to sad music when I'm sad and it never ends well. 
I bet I see a lot of Coon suits today 
I blame my sleeping late every day this week on the weather. 
I can already tell today isn't going to be a good day.  #tiredasfuck
I decided to start reading the daily news during breakfast this wk...think I'll stop. 
I didn't know I took night classes  #stupidweather
I don't get how people find giving up so easy 
I don't think Mother Nature has gotten the memo that it's Spring right now.. 
Id rather be at home with a blanket and nickelodeon #rainyday  #relaxing
I'd rather have a flowerless May, than a rainy April... #sickoftherain
