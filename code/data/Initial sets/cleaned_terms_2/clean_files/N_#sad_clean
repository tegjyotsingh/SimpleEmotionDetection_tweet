Some people are headed no where in life. 
Some people are more concerned about their phones and social medias/texts, than anyone or anything around them. 
Some people are so thick and backwards it's unreal get a life worry about your own beliefs rather than try convince others of it 
Some people are so unfriendly aren't they?
Some people disgust me! 
Some people go through life hurting others and never fully grasping the impact of their actions. So  but hopefully there is #karma
Some people have no sense of humour #boring 
Some people have no shame

Some people just make me  all day. No lie...
Some people just never learn... No matter how many times they make the same mistake... 
Some people look better online than in person lol  but it's the god honest truth
Some people must have a very exciting life with writing a status to rate looks or for a paragraph! #greatlife #likeforlooks 
Some people never change. 
Some people on ask.fm obviously send themselves questions 
Some people only care about the material things. 
Some people pretend to care just so they can get a better seat to watch your struggle. Every helping hand isn't always that helpful 
Some people really don't know how blessed they really are...  "Count your Blessings, Not your problems"
Some people really know how to hurt my feelings! 
Some people smoke weed to try to look cool. 
Some people take jokes too far and don't realize how much it can hurt someone

Sometimes people do stuff, and I can never understand why they would ever do that #messedup 
Sometimes people need to be hurt the way they hurt others in order to grow as a person. Too often they're still lost even after that. .
Sometimes.  #badday #abettertomorrow #grumpy http://t.co/Ye41nYpk5c
Sometimes trying and trying again doesnt work out as planned when you have tried with all your heart. #sigh #strong  #storyofmylife
Sometimes, u try to do the right thing & make peace but I guess u can't force peace & friendship w/those determined to hate & be alone 
sometimes wen I dwell on school memories, I stop myself, cos I think that I'm the only lame 20 something that still remembers that 
Sometimes when I close my eyes, I can't see. :( 
Sometimes you don't get what you want, but you can't dwell on it, just pick up the pieces and move on.  #true
Sometimes you just can't hold the heavy weight anymore, and you just have to let it fall and start over.  #broken #lonely
Sometimes you just want to say to hell with it, to hell with everyone   #fedup
