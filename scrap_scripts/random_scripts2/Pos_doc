scares u ull feel invigorated alive
nothin like freshly painted nails bones and tea
nothin like listening to some good old georgestrait posemoti
not in until tomorrow
not moved out my bed since half
not much beats being snuggled up in bed in the morning reading sense and sensibility with nice warm coffee
not one stinking meeting today
not ricky stuart then by some fluke i got a seat on the quiet coach
not sad the year is ending but still looking forward to sending her off right sauced summer
not working till wednesday
no washing up to do tonight
now at home payed some bills gonna to talk
